# cafe-kansas-site
This is a 'dummy' website for a cafe. This was treated as a starter project to learn and work through beginner coding struggles by designing and laying out a page with some (what I think would be considered) simple html, css, and javascript. 

The site wasn't intended to become a fully functional site for a cafe that could realistically take orders from customers, therefore, it has no back-end functionality to it. The info. entered on the Order page is simply verified by javascript, and if valid hides one div element and shows another. No data is sent anywhere.

Main takeaways from project:

- Use very clear naming conventions for classes, ids, names, functions, variables, etc. -->  Later in the project I realized that the html class/id names that I had created early on were pretty uninformative and generic in terms of what part of the page they referenced. I can see how making these names specific and unique can be super helpful when coming back to old code, or when someone else is viewing a project that they didn't create.
          
- Designing and building a project takes a lot of thought --> As roadblocks came up, most of the time the brainstorming on how to fix the problem in a way that makes sense and won't create problems down the road took more time than actually writing the code out.
