USING THE SITE:

The files are organized by file type. All html files should be within a folder named 'cafe_kansas_html', css files need to be in a folder named 'cafe_kansas_css', jpg/png files in a folder named 'cafe_kansas_pics', javascript files in a folder named 'cafe_kansas_js', and woff files in a folder named 'cafe_kansas_fonts'. Also, all files will need to retain their original names.

The site contains four pages. The 'Place Order' page is where you can select items to 'order' within the drop-down menus. Once going through the checkout process, no information will be sent anywhere (it is a 'dummy' checkout so to say {this is mentioned below}).

SUMMARY:

This is a website for a cafe named 'Cafe Kansas'. This was treated as a starter project to learn and work through beginner coding struggles by designing and laying out a page with some html, css, and javascript. Since it's a starter project, and the idea was for a very small, family-owned cafe, the design and theme is a departure from the 'modern' formats that are seen across most restaurant/cafe sites these days. 

The site also wasn't intended to become a fully functional site for a cafe that could realistically take orders from customers (at least this wasn't the intention for the time being), therefore, it has no back-end functionality to it. The info. entered on the 'Place Order' page is verified by javascript, and if the input is valid, it simply hides the checkout pop-up box then shows the thank you pop-up box. No data is sent anywhere.
