# Cafe Kansas

## SUMMARY

This is a website for a cafe named 'Cafe Kansas'. It was a starter project used to learn and get familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a little bit of jQuery. Since it's a starter project, and the idea was for a very small, family-owned cafe, the visual appearance isn't as modern looking as most restaurant/cafe sites on the web today. 

The site wasn't intended to store data entered by users when placing an order, therefore, it has no back-end functionality. While using the 'Place Order' page, all user input is validated by Javascript and used to either hide or display HTML elements. No data is sent anywhere when the form is submitted.

## SET UP

### Access site through web

The site can be found at http://cafekansas.epizy.com.

### Download and run site locally

The files are organized by file type. All html files should be within a folder named 'cafe_kansas_html', css files need to be in a folder named 'cafe_kansas_css', jpg/png files in a folder named 'cafe_kansas_pics', javascript files in a folder named 'cafe_kansas_js', and woff files in a folder named 'cafe_kansas_fonts'. Also, all files will need to retain their original names.

The site contains four pages. The 'Place Order' page is where you can select items to 'order' within the drop-down menus. Once going through the checkout process, no information will be sent or saved anywhere (it is a 'dummy' checkout).
