# cafe-kansas-site
This is a 'dummy' website for a cafe. This was treated as a starter project to learn and work through beginner coding struggles by designing and laying out a page with some (what I think would be considered) simple html, css, and javascript. Since it's a starter project, and the idea was for a very small, family-owned cafe, the design and theme is a departure from the 'modern' formats that are seen across most restaurant/cafe sites these days. 

The site also wasn't intended to become a fully functional site for a cafe that could realistically take orders from customers, therefore, it has no back-end functionality to it. The info. entered on the 'Place Order' page is verified by javascript, and if the input is valid, it simply hides one div element and shows another. No data is sent anywhere.

Main takeaways from project:

- Use very clear naming conventions for classes, ids, names, functions, variables, etc. -->  Later in the project it was realized that the html class/id names that had been created early on were pretty uninformative and generic in terms of what part of the page they referenced. I can see how making these names specific and unique can be super helpful when coming back to old code, or when someone is viewing a project they didn't create.
          
- Designing and building a project takes a lot of thought --> As roadblocks came up, more often than not the brainstorming on how to fix a problem in a way that made sense and woudln't create problems down the road took more time than actually writing the code out.

- The JS likely isn't as efficient and orderly as it could be --> Hopefully this will improve in the future, but at this point I did the best I could.
